The Classroom Visual Assistant is an iOS tool to help visually impaired students see the board during class. The student runs the Classroom Visual Assistant on their smartphone and/or tablet. This application enables the user to automatically capture images of the board, process the images using filters that make the text on the board easier to read, and view the images on their device.
